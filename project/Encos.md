During my internship at **Nanjing Encos**, I focused on end-to-end mechanical design and structural analysis of custom motors and planetary gear reducers. My work combined CAD modeling, assembly design, tolerance analysis, and firmware-level tuning to validate motor performance.

---

## ⚙️ Key Responsibilities  
• Designed and assembled custom motors using **SolidWorks**  
• Produced engineering drawings and coordinated DFM with suppliers  
• Designed **5+ planetary reducer gearboxes** for different torque/speed requirements  
• Calibrated and tuned motors using **VESC firmware**  
• Improved manufacturability through tolerance refinements and optimized fits  
• Conducted internal layout evaluations to minimize size while maximizing performance  

---

## 🛠 Technical Contributions  
• Developed CAD models for housings, shafts, rotors, stators, and magnet sets  
• Ran structural evaluations to reduce gear tooth stress and casing deformation  
• Integrated bearings, PCB control boards, and windings into compact assemblies  
• Created machining drawings with GD&T callouts for high-precision manufacturing  
• Optimized gear ratios, tooth profiles, and spacing to reduce noise & backlash  

---

## 📈 Impact & Results  
• Delivered several custom motor prototypes used in internal electromechanical systems  
• Reduced gearbox backlash and improved torque transmission through redesign iterations  
• Validated performance through VESC tuning, thermal assessment, and load testing  
• Contributed to improved CAD standards and documentation practices at the company
