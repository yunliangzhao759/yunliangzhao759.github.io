## About Me  
I am a Master’s student in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, passionate about robotics, control systems, and mechanical design.  

Through my research at CMU’s MetaMobility Lab, an engineering internship in custom motor development, and leadership in the RoboMaster robotics competition, I have gained hands-on experience in **robot design, control, and fabrication**.  

I enjoy applying **engineering and quantitative methods** to real-world problems and am seeking opportunities in **mechanical engineering, robotics, and related industries**.
