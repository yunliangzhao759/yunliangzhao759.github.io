## About Me  
I am a second-year Masterâ€™s student in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, with a strong background in robotics, control systems, and mechanical design.  

My passion for robotics started in high school competitions such as FRC and **RoboMaster**, where I developed both technical and teamwork skills. At NYU, I served as **Captain of the RoboMaster Team**, leading over 90 members to design, fabricate, and compete with advanced robots. These experiences shaped my ability to collaborate across large teams, manage complex projects, and bring designs from concept to reality.  

I enjoy applying quantitative and engineering methods to solve real-world problems, and I am also exploring opportunities to apply these skills in consulting.
