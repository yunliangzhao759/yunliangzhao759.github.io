## About Me  
I am a second-year Masterâ€™s student in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, with a strong background in robotics, control systems, and mechanical design. My passion for robotics started in high school competitions such as FRC and RoboMaster, where I developed both technical and teamwork skills.  

I enjoy applying quantitative and engineering methods to solve real-world problems. I am also interested in consulting, where I can leverage my analytical training to explore diverse industries, work with people from different backgrounds, and create practical impact.
