## About Me  
I am a Masterâ€™s student in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, passionate about robotics, control systems, and mechanical design.  

Through my research at CMUâ€™s MetaMobility Lab, an engineering internship in custom motor development, and leadership in the RoboMaster robotics competition, I have gained hands-on experience in **robot design, control, and fabrication**.  

I enjoy applying **engineering and quantitative methods** to real-world problems and am seeking opportunities in **mechanical engineering, robotics, and related industries**.
